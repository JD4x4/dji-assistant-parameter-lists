# dji_assistant_parameter_lists

Config folder contains individual .cfg files taken from DJI Assistant v1.1.2 (beta) folders

Spark Compare.txt is a tab delimited file comparing my Spark parameters with initial values, to the two .cfg files found for WM100.

Lines in .cfg files which have a prefix of "1" are assumed to be read-only until otherwise determined.

CAUTION: web_collections_and_snippets folder is just for param info & comments collections that may (or may NOT) be verified, and may be ambigious as to which aircraft they apply to!
